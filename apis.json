			"description": "ClickMeter was founded in 2012 as a byproduct of an experienced web-marketing agency. The ClickMeter System was initially a web tool created to address the needs of our agency to precisely count and track the web-marketing actions we performed for our customers.The system evolved rapidly, and emerged as one of the most widely used software solutions in our agency to collect, analyze, and share data for and with our customers. After few years after the development of the first ClickMeter system, we decided to go live with a service that can be useful to everyone involved in web-marketing activities.",
